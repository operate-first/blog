This is the first paragraph of the post, it is not an academic paper thesis.
Instead, this is the chance to grab your reader by giving them the most important information up front.
This is where the formula of _The Five Ws, One H_ comes in:

- **Who** is this post about
- **What** did they do or are going to do
- **Why** is it interesting
- **Where** is it happening
- **When** is it happening
- **How** is it going to happen

It's almost like you are going to tell the punchline of a joke up front, and then work backwards toward the less interesting parts.
This is because you are not here to tell a story that is entrancing and captivating.
You are here to capture and hold interest about the topic you are writing about.
So put your topic right up front, and give your Big Reveal the first paragraph attention it deserves.

Journalism calls this the [inverted pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pyramid_(journalism).
You may find when applying this principle, one of your last paragraphs gets moved up to become the first paragraph.

> :bulb: **Tip** If you are writing technical content, the [Op1st technical markup style guide](https://github.com/operate-first/community-handbook/blob/main/contributing/tecnical-markup-style-guide.md) shows you how to markup code, user interface instructions, and so forth.

## Have some sections

You can divide a blog post into logical sections, which helps the reader stay with the story you are telling and not get lost in a long line of paragraphs.

Speaking of paragraphs, if you look at the source of this MarkDown, you will see each sentence in these paragraphs is on a line by itself.
Because there is no space between this line and the one above it, the sentences are rendered into the same paragraph.

The reason we have each sentence on its own line is for the editing and reviewing process.
When someone has a suggestion to make or question to ask about a particular part of your post, it will most often be a change in a single sentence.
When the paragraphs are all one line, with each sentence on the same line, the entire paragraph is presented as one block for the _diff_, which is where GitHub shows the changes (differences) between two files.
When the sentences are on their own line, it is much easier to see where a change has happened, and to comment or suggest on smaller parts of the work.

## Sections make content easier to understand

When you put content into sections, it forces you to think about how others see/don't see the organization of your information.
It is not uncommon to restructure a post after adding in sections.
The sections can make it clear that a paragraph or sentence belongs in one section over another.

## Have a conclusion

Having a few sentences that conclude or summarize the blog post, even if it's repetitive for the opening of the post.
It's a reasonable and useful way to end a blog, making sure readers are taking away your key points.
